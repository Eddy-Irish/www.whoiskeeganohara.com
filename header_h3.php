I still love Philosophy, and you\'ll get to know a lot more about what kind of philosophy I like, which philosophers are my favorite, and a lot more
			    about me on the site, but the site\'s main purpose is to showcase a few applications that I\'ve independently built
			    using tools, frameworks, languages, and technologies that I also learned and taught myself independently.</h3>
